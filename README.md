Basic Python scripts

A few days ago I started to write in python from scratch.
I've just done those python scripts just for my personal (basic) needs and to learn something new.

reinstall-modules.py
Reinstalls all the currently installed python modules.
I started to do it just to fix an error on windows after changing the python's folder since "pip" adds the full path to the executables (.exe) generated in "\Scripts".

( For ex. - Fatal error in launcher: Unable to create process using x:\xyz\python.exe )

With this script you can reinstall all of them without using the (non working?) pip executable.
This is my first, ever, script done in python.


**The scripts should not be used in production**
